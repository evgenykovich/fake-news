## Architecture

The service is built using NestJS and follows a modular architecture:

- **Article Module**: Core article management and enrichment
- **News Sources**: Extensible news source integration
- **OpenAI Integration**: AI-powered content enrichment
- **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance management
- **Queue System**: Asynchronous processing
- **Monitoring**: Performance and health metrics

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key
- News API key

```

## Running the Service

```bash
npm start
```

## API Documentation

The service provides a Swagger API documentation at:

```
http://localhost:8000/api
```

run with:

```bash
npm run swagger
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

The service uses Prometheus for monitoring and metrics collection. The metrics are available at:

```
http://localhost:8000/metrics
```

## Error Handling and Logging

The service implements comprehensive error handling and logging:

- **Error Handling**: All API endpoints are wrapped in a try-catch block to handle errors gracefully.
- **Logging**: Detailed error logs are captured using NestJS's default logger and Winston.

## Testing

The service includes unit tests and integration tests:

- **Unit Tests**: Jest is used for unit testing the core functionality.
- **Integration Tests**: Jest is used for integration testing the API endpoints.

run tests with:

```bash
npm test
```
